## üí° How It Works

### Main Screen
   - Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a clean and intuitive dashboard. From here, they can navigate through options like accessing the panic button, entering family details, and viewing nearby safe locations.
   - Navigation is simple and seamless, with each option clearly laid out for easy use during emergencies.

### Emergency Map
   - The map is centered around your current location and updates in real time.
   - You can zoom in or out to check nearby **safe zones**, **hospitals**, **shelters**, and **disaster areas** marked with color-coded circles that represent different **disaster intensities** (high, medium, low).
   - **Disaster zones** show details such as intensity (e.g., flood, earthquake), while **safe locations** display their type (shelter, medical), capacity, and availability status.

### Guardian Eye
   - Enables hands-free interaction with the app using eye-gaze detection technology.
   - Perfect for situations where users are unable to move or operate their devices manually.
   - Helps send emergency alerts, navigate maps, or access features with just a glance.

### Panic Button
   - In case of an emergency, users can quickly trigger the **panic button**.
   - It instantly shares the user‚Äôs current location along with the emergency type (medical, fire, disaster) with local emergency responders.

### AI Medical Assistant
   - Need medical advice or have health concerns? Our AI chatbot provides quick responses to medical queries, helping you make informed decisions during stressful times.
   - Perfect for minor injuries, first aid tips, or medical emergencies where immediate attention is required.

### Safe Location Reporting
   - If you are at a **safe location** or have found one (such as a shelter or medical facility), you can report its details (location, capacity, and type) for others to view.
   - Users can also update the status of reported safe locations, ensuring others know whether the area is available or full.

### Family Details Form
   - In emergencies, it's crucial to have up-to-date contact and location information for your family members.
   - Use the **Family Details Form** to securely record names, locations, and contact info for all family members, ensuring you can reach them quickly during a crisis.
